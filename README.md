# odin-recipes
A website practice using TOP, making a website about recipes
=======
Well, this is the first time I've opened README.md file, and it opened package.json, so I hope everything will go okay.
So, this project is made to impement everything that I've learned so far from TOP (The Odin Project).
The project will implement:
    -Creating recipes directory, as well as index.html page
    -Creating usual boilerplate HTML for each of the pages created
    -Creating anchor elements to relative link the .html pages created inside of recipes directory
    -Adding an img file to each of the recipes pages
    -Creating paragraph descriptions of recipes
    -Creating unordered list of ingredients needed for recipe
    -Creating "Steps" for making the dish using an ordered list
